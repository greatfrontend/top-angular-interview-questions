title: What are the differences between component and directive?
---

## TL;DR

In Angular, both components and directives are classes decorated with metadata that interact with the DOM. The key difference is their purpose and structure.

- A **component** is a special type of directive that _always_ has a template. It's used to create reusable UI blocks with their own view, logic, and encapsulated styles. You declare it using the `@Component` decorator.
- A **directive** modifies the behavior or appearance of an _existing_ DOM element, component, or another directive. It does _not_ have a template or encapsulated styles of its own. You declare it using the `@Directive` decorator.

Think of components as building blocks for your UI, while directives are tools to enhance or change those blocks or other elements.

## What is a component?

A component is the most fundamental building block in an Angular application. It controls a patch of the screen called a view.

### Components are directives with templates

Technically, a component is a type of directive, but with a template. Every component must be associated with a template that defines its view.

### Components have encapsulated styles

Components can define their own styles that are typically scoped only to the elements within their template, preventing style conflicts with other parts of the application.

### Components have a view and logic

A component class contains the logic (data and methods) that drives the view defined in its template.

### Declared with `@Component` decorator

Components are defined using the `@Component` decorator, which provides metadata like `selector`, `templateUrl` or `template`, and `styleUrls` or `styles`.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css'],
})
export class MyComponent {
  // Component logic
  title = 'Hello from Component';
}
```

### Used as custom HTML elements

Components are typically used in templates as custom HTML element tags based on their `selector`.

```html
<app-my-component></app-my-component>
```

## What is a directive?

A directive is a class that modifies the behavior or appearance of a DOM element, component, or another directive.

### Directives do not have templates

Unlike components, directives do not have an associated template or view of their own. They operate on existing elements.

### Directives do not have encapsulated styles

Directives cannot define encapsulated styles. If they need to apply styles, they typically do so by manipulating the host element's style or class properties programmatically.

### Declared with `@Directive` decorator

Directives are defined using the `@Directive` decorator, which provides metadata, most importantly the `selector`.

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]', // Attribute selector
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}

  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
    this.highlight('yellow');
  }

  @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {
    this.highlight('');
  }

  private highlight(color: string) {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = color;
  }
}
```

### Used as attributes or structural prefixes

Directives are applied to elements in templates, usually as attributes (attribute directives) or with a prefix like `*` (structural directives).

```html
<p appHighlight>This text will be highlighted.</p>

<div *ngIf="isVisible">This div is shown conditionally.</div>
```

### Types of directives

Angular has three types of directives:

- **Components:** Directives with a template (as discussed above).
- **Attribute directives:** Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. Examples include `NgStyle`, `NgClass`, and custom directives like `appHighlight`.
- **Structural directives:** Change the DOM layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements. Examples include `NgIf`, `NgFor`, and `NgSwitch`. They are often prefixed with `*`.

## Key differences summarized

| Feature           | Component                                | Directive                                                            |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Create reusable UI blocks with a view    | Modify existing elements/components/directives                       |
| **Template**      | Yes, required                            | No                                                                   |
| **Styles**        | Yes, encapsulated styles                 | No (modifies host styles programmatically)                           |
| **Decorator**     | `@Component`                             | `@Directive`                                                         |
| **Usage in HTML** | As an element tag (`<app-my-component>`) | As an attribute (`<div myDirective>`) or structural prefix (`*ngIf`) |
| **DOM Impact**    | Creates a new element with its view      | Modifies an existing element or its structure                        |
