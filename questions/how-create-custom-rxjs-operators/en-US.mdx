title: How do you create custom RxJS operators?
---

## TL;DR

Creating custom RxJS operators allows you to encapsulate common observable transformation logic for reusability and readability. A custom operator is essentially a function that takes a source observable as input and returns a new observable, typically by applying one or more existing RxJS operators using the `pipe` method.

The most common pattern for a custom operator is a function that returns another function. The outer function can optionally take configuration arguments, and the inner function takes the source observable and returns the transformed observable.

Here's a basic structure:

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

function myCustomOperator<T>(): (source: Observable<T>) => Observable<string> {
  return (source: Observable<T>) => {
    return source.pipe(
      // Apply existing operators here
      map(value => `Processed: ${value}`)
    );
  };
}
```

You then use it with the `pipe` method on an observable:

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';

of(1, 2, 3)
  .pipe(
    myCustomOperator() // Call the factory function
  )
  .subscribe(value => console.log(value));
// Output:
// Processed: 1
// Processed: 2
// Processed: 3
```

This pattern makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain by abstracting complex observable sequences into single, descriptive functions.

## Why create custom RxJS operators?

Creating custom operators offers several benefits:

### Reusability

If you find yourself repeating the same sequence of RxJS operators in multiple places in your application, packaging them into a custom operator allows you to write the logic once and reuse it.

### Readability

Complex observable pipelines can become difficult to read. A custom operator can give a descriptive name to a sequence of operations, making the code that uses it much clearer. For example, instead of `source$.pipe(filter(...), map(...), distinctUntilChanged(...))`, you might have `source$.pipe(filterAndMapUnique(...))`.

### Abstraction

Custom operators hide the implementation details of the observable transformation, allowing developers to focus on what the operator does rather than how it does it.

## Structure of a custom operator

A custom RxJS operator is a function that takes a source `Observable` as its input and returns a new `Observable` that emits values based on the transformation logic applied.

The most common and recommended way to create a custom operator is using the "pipeable operator" pattern. This involves creating a function that returns another function. The returned function is the actual operator that will be used within the `pipe` method.

### The pipeable operator pattern

The structure looks like this:

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

// Outer function (optional arguments for configuration)
function myCustomOperator<T, R>(/* config arguments */): (
  source: Observable<T>
) => Observable<R> {
  // Return the inner function (the actual operator)
  return (source: Observable<T>) => {
    // Inside here, you define the transformation logic
    // You typically use source.pipe() and apply existing operators
    return source
      .pipe
      // ... apply operators like map, filter, switchMap, etc. ...
      ();
  };
}
```

- The outer function `myCustomOperator` is often called a "factory function". It's what you call when you use the operator inside `pipe`. It can accept arguments to configure the operator's behavior.
- The inner function is the actual operator. It receives the `source` observable as input and must return a new `Observable`.
- Inside the inner function, you use `source.pipe()` to apply standard RxJS operators to transform the stream.

## Simple custom operator example

Let's create a simple custom operator called `logAndMap` that logs each value emitted by the source observable and then maps it to a string indicating it has been processed.

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap, map } from 'rxjs/operators';

/**
 * Custom operator that logs each value and then maps it to a processed string.
 */
function logAndMap<T>(): (source: Observable<T>) => Observable<string> {
  return (source: Observable<T>) => {
    return source.pipe(
      tap(value => console.log('Received value:', value)), // Log the value
      map(value => `Processed: ${value}`) // Map to a new string
    );
  };
}
```

### Using the custom operator

You use this custom operator just like any built-in pipeable operator:

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { logAndMap } from './log-and-map.operator'; // Assuming the operator is in this file

of(10, 20, 30)
  .pipe(
    logAndMap() // Call the factory function
  )
  .subscribe(
    value => console.log('Subscribed value:', value),
    error => console.error(error),
    () => console.log('Complete')
  );
```

When you run this code, the output will be:

```
Received value: 10
Subscribed value: Processed: 10
Received value: 20
Subscribed value: Processed: 20
Received value: 30
Subscribed value: Processed: 30
Complete
```

## Custom operator with configuration

Custom operators become even more powerful when they accept configuration arguments. Let's modify the `logAndMap` operator to accept a prefix for the log message.

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap, map } from 'rxjs/operators';

/**
 * Custom operator that logs each value with a prefix and then maps it to a processed string.
 * @param logPrefix The prefix to use for the log message.
 */
function logAndMapWithPrefix<T>(
  logPrefix: string
): (source: Observable<T>) => Observable<string> {
  return (source: Observable<T>) => {
    return source.pipe(
      tap(value => console.log(`${logPrefix}:`, value)), // Use the prefix
      map(value => `Processed: ${value}`)
    );
  };
}
```

### Using the configurable operator

Now you pass the configuration argument when calling the factory function inside `pipe`:

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { logAndMapWithPrefix } from './log-and-map-with-prefix.operator';

of('A', 'B', 'C')
  .pipe(
    logAndMapWithPrefix('--- Data ---') // Pass the prefix here
  )
  .subscribe(
    value => console.log('Subscribed value:', value),
    error => console.error(error),
    () => console.log('Complete')
  );
```

The output will now include the custom prefix:

```
--- Data ---: A
Subscribed value: Processed: A
--- Data ---: B
Subscribed value: Processed: B
--- Data ---: C
Subscribed value: Processed: C
Complete
```

This pattern of using a factory function that returns the actual operator is the standard way to create custom pipeable operators in modern RxJS (since version 5.5+).
