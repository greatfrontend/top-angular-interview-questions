title: What is RxJS?

## TL;DR

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code sequences. Think of it as dealing with streams of data or events over time.

Its core concepts are:

- **Observables:** Represent a stream of values that can be emitted over time.
- **Observers (or Subscribers):** Listen to an Observable and react to the values it emits, as well as error or completion notifications.
- **Operators:** Pure functions that take an Observable as input and return a new Observable. They are used to transform, filter, or combine streams.

Angular heavily uses RxJS for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests (the `HttpClient` returns Observables), routing events, form control value changes, and custom events via `EventEmitter`. It provides a powerful and consistent way to manage complex asynchronous logic in a declarative manner.

## What is RxJS?

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library that brings the concepts of reactive programming to JavaScript. It provides tools for working with asynchronous data streams using Observables. Reactive programming is a paradigm focused on reacting to changes or events as they occur over time.

## Core concepts of RxJS

RxJS is built around a few fundamental concepts:

### Observables

An Observable represents a stream of values that can be emitted over time. It's a push-based system, meaning the Observable "pushes" values to its subscribers when they become available. Observables can emit zero, one, or multiple values, and can optionally send an error or a completion notification. They are lazy; the stream doesn't start emitting values until someone subscribes to it.

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

// Create a simple observable that emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes
const myObservable = new Observable<number>(subscriber => {
  subscriber.next(1);
  subscriber.next(2);
  subscriber.next(3);
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next(4);
    subscriber.complete(); // Signal completion
  }, 1000);
});
```

### Observers (or Subscribers)

An Observer is an object with methods that define how to handle the values emitted by an Observable, as well as error and completion notifications. When you call the `subscribe()` method on an Observable, you provide an Observer (or callback functions for `next`, `error`, and `complete`).

The Observer object typically has three methods:

- `next(value)`: Called for each value emitted by the Observable
- `error(err)`: Called if the Observable encounters an error
- `complete()`: Called when the Observable finishes emitting values

```typescript
// Subscribe to the observable
myObservable.subscribe({
  next: value => console.log('Received value:', value),
  error: err => console.error('Something went wrong:', err),
  complete: () => console.log('Observable completed'),
});

// Output:
// Received value: 1
// Received value: 2
// Received value: 3
// Received value: 4 (after 1 second)
// Observable completed
```

### Operators

Operators are pure functions that allow you to manipulate Observables. They take an input Observable and return a new Observable, without modifying the original. Operators are the building blocks for complex asynchronous logic. They are typically used with the `pipe()` method on an Observable.

Examples of common operators include:

- `map`: Transforms each value emitted by the source Observable
- `filter`: Emits only those values from the source Observable that satisfy a specified predicate
- `debounceTime`: Waits for a specified time to pass between emissions before emitting the latest value
- `switchMap`: Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, unsubscribing from the previous projected Observable

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map, filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

const source = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

const example = source.pipe(
  filter(num => num % 2 === 0), // Keep only even numbers
  map(num => num * 10) // Multiply each by 10
);

example.subscribe(value => console.log('Processed value:', value));

// Output:
// Processed value: 20
// Processed value: 40
```

## Why is RxJS used in Angular?

Angular leverages RxJS heavily to manage asynchronous operations and event handling in a consistent and declarative way.

### Handling HTTP requests

The `HttpClient` service in Angular returns Observables. This allows you to easily handle responses, errors, and chain multiple requests using RxJS operators.

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { catchError, map } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    this.http
      .get('/api/data')
      .pipe(
        map(response => response as any[]), // Type assertion or interface
        catchError(error => {
          console.error('Error fetching data', error);
          return of([]); // Return an empty array or handle error
        })
      )
      .subscribe(data => {
        console.log('Data received:', data);
      });
  }
}
```

### Event handling

Angular's `EventEmitter` extends RxJS's `Subject`, making it an Observable. This is used for component communication (`@Output` properties). You can also create Observables from DOM events using `fromEvent`.

```typescript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators';

const button = document.querySelector('button');
if (button) {
  fromEvent(button, 'click')
    .pipe(
      debounceTime(300) // Prevent rapid clicks
    )
    .subscribe(event => {
      console.log('Button clicked (debounced)', event);
    });
}
```

### Routing

The `ActivatedRoute` service provides Observables for route parameters (`params`), query parameters (`queryParams`), and route data (`data`), allowing you to react to changes in the route.

```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class ProductDetailComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.params
      .pipe(
        switchMap(params => {
          const productId = params['id'];
          // Fetch product data based on ID (e.g., using an HTTP service)
          // Assuming a service method returns an Observable
          // return this.productService.getProduct(productId);
          console.log('Fetching product with ID:', productId);
          return of({ id: productId, name: `Product ${productId}` }); // Example observable
        })
      )
      .subscribe(product => {
        console.log('Loaded product:', product);
      });
  }
}
```

### State management

Libraries like NgRx and Akita, commonly used for state management in Angular, are built upon RxJS Observables to manage and react to state changes.
