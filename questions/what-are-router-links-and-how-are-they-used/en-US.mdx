title: What are router links and how are they used?

## TL;DR

Router links, provided by the `routerLink` directive in Angular, are the primary way to enable navigation between different routes within your application using declarative syntax in your templates. Instead of using the standard HTML `href` attribute, which causes a full page reload, `routerLink` leverages Angular's Router to perform client-side navigation.

You typically apply `routerLink` to an anchor (`<a>`) tag, but it can be used on any element.

Here are common ways to use it:

- **Static path:**
  ```html
  <a routerLink="/dashboard">Go to Dashboard</a>
  ```
- **Path with parameters:** Use an array syntax.
  ```html
  <a [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">View Product</a>
  ```
- **Path with query parameters and fragment:**
  ```html
  <a
    [routerLink]="['/search']"
    [queryParams]="{ category: 'electronics' }"
    fragment="results"
    >Search Electronics</a
  >
  ```

Using `routerLink` ensures that Angular's routing mechanism handles the navigation, allowing for features like route guards, resolvers, and smooth transitions without a full page refresh.

## What are router links?

Router links are a feature of the Angular Router, implemented as a directive called `routerLink`. They provide a declarative way to navigate between different routes defined in your Angular application directly from your templates.

Unlike the standard HTML `href` attribute, which triggers a full browser page reload when clicked, the `routerLink` directive intercepts the click event and instructs Angular's Router to navigate to the specified path using the browser's History API. This results in a much faster and smoother user experience, as only the necessary components are loaded and rendered without losing the application's state.

The `routerLink` directive is typically applied to an `<a>` element, but it can be used on any element that can trigger an event (like a `<div>` or `<button>`) if combined with an event listener that calls the router's `navigate` or `navigateByUrl` methods programmatically. However, using it on `<a>` tags is the most common and semantically correct approach for navigation links.

## How to use router links

The `routerLink` directive can accept various types of values to define the navigation path, including static strings, arrays for dynamic paths with parameters, and objects for query parameters and fragments.

### Basic usage with a static path

For simple, static paths, you can assign the path string directly to the `routerLink` attribute.

```html
<a routerLink="/home">Home</a> <a routerLink="/about-us">About Us</a>
```

The path should typically start with a leading slash (`/`) to indicate an absolute path from the application's root.

### Usage with parameters

When navigating to routes that require parameters (e.g., viewing a specific item by ID), you use an array syntax with property binding (`[]`). The array contains the path segments followed by the parameter values.

```html
<!-- Assuming productId is a component property -->
<a [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">View Product Details</a>

<!-- Example with multiple parameters -->
<a [routerLink]="['/users', userId, 'edit']">Edit User</a>
```

In these examples, `productId` and `userId` are variables or properties in the component class that hold the actual values for the parameters.

### Usage with query parameters and fragments

You can include query parameters and URL fragments using the `queryParams` and `fragment` input properties, also with property binding.

```html
<!-- Navigate to /search?category=electronics -->
<a [routerLink]="['/search']" [queryParams]="{ category: 'electronics' }"
  >Search Electronics</a
>

<!-- Navigate to /article#section2 -->
<a [routerLink]="['/article']" fragment="section2">Go to Section 2</a>

<!-- Combine parameters, query params, and fragment -->
<a
  [routerLink]="['/items', itemId]"
  [queryParams]="{ sort: 'price', filter: 'new' }"
  fragment="details"
  >View Item with Options</a
>
```

The `queryParams` input takes an object where keys are query parameter names and values are their corresponding values. The `fragment` input takes a string.

### Usage with relative paths

By default, paths in `routerLink` are absolute (relative to the application root). You can specify relative navigation using the `relativeTo` input property, providing the `ActivatedRoute` of the current component.

```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-item-detail',
  template: `
    <h2>Item Detail</h2>
    <!-- Navigates to /items/{{itemId}}/overview -->
    <a [routerLink]="['overview']" [relativeTo]="route">Overview</a>
    <!-- Navigates to /items/{{itemId}}/specs -->
    <a [routerLink]="['specs']" [relativeTo]="route">Specifications</a>
    <!-- Navigates to /items (up one level) -->
    <a [routerLink]="['../']" [relativeTo]="route">Back to List</a>
  `,
})
export class ItemDetailComponent {
  itemId = 123; // Example item ID

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}
}
```

The `relativeTo` property tells the router to resolve the `routerLink` path relative to the route that activated the component. Path segments like `'overview'`, `'specs'`, or `'../'` are then interpreted based on the current URL.

### Usage with `routerLinkActive`

The `routerLinkActive` directive is commonly used alongside `routerLink` to apply CSS classes to an element when its `routerLink` is the active route.

```html
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/home" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a>
  <a routerLink="/dashboard" routerLinkActive="active">Dashboard</a>
</nav>
```

When the current URL matches `/home`, the class `active` will be added to the "Home" link. When the URL matches `/dashboard`, the class `active` will be added to the "Dashboard" link. You can specify multiple classes separated by spaces.

## Why use router links instead of `href`?

Using `routerLink` is the standard and recommended way to handle navigation within an Angular single-page application for several key reasons:

- **Client-side navigation:** `routerLink` prevents the browser's default full page reload behavior. It uses the History API to change the URL and allows Angular's Router to swap components dynamically, providing a faster and more seamless user experience.
- **Integration with Angular Router features:** Navigation via `routerLink` goes through the Angular Router's lifecycle. This means route guards (`CanActivate`, `CanLoad`, etc.) are checked, resolvers (`Resolve`) are run to fetch data before component activation, and route events are emitted, allowing you to react to navigation changes.
- **State preservation:** Because the page doesn't fully reload, the application's state (e.g., service data, component state) is preserved across navigation, which is crucial for single-page applications.
- **Active link styling:** The companion `routerLinkActive` directive makes it trivial to style the currently active navigation link, providing visual feedback to the user.
- **Parameter handling:** `routerLink` provides a structured way to include route parameters, query parameters, and fragments directly in the template syntax.

Using `href` for internal application links bypasses the Angular Router entirely, leading to full page reloads, loss of application state, and ignoring any route guards or resolvers you might have configured. Therefore, `href` should generally only be used for external links that navigate away from your Angular application.
