title: How do you manually trigger change detection?
---

## TL;DR

You might need to manually trigger change detection in Angular, especially when using the `OnPush` change detection strategy or when working outside of Angular's default Zone.js environment (like with Web Workers or certain third-party libraries).

The primary ways to manually trigger change detection are:

- `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`: Runs change detection for the current component and its descendants. Use this when you know a change has occurred within the component's view or its children that Angular might not otherwise detect, especially after detaching a component

- `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`: Marks the component and its ancestors as needing to be checked during the _next_ change detection cycle. It doesn't trigger the check immediately. This is the preferred method when using `OnPush`, as it efficiently signals Angular that a relevant input or observable has emitted, ensuring the component is checked during the next global tick

- `ApplicationRef.tick()`: Triggers change detection for the _entire_ application. This is less common for component-specific updates and more for global scenarios or testing

```typescript
import {
  Component,
  ChangeDetectorRef,
  ChangeDetectionStrategy,
  ApplicationRef,
  signal, // Available from Angular 16 onwards
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <p>{{ message() }}</p>
    <button (click)="updateMessage()">Update Message (Manual CD)</button>
  `,
  // Often used with OnPush strategy
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  standalone: true, // Example with standalone component
})
export class MyComponent {
  // Using Signals for reactivity (Available from Angular 16 onwards)
  message = signal('Initial message');

  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef, private appRef: ApplicationRef) {}

  updateMessage() {
    // Update the signal. With OnPush, if `message` was a regular property,
    // we'd need manual CD. With Signals, it often handles itself, but manual CD
    // might still be useful for edge cases or non-signal changes.
    this.message.set('Message updated at ' + new Date().toLocaleTimeString());

    // Choose one method depending on the scenario:

    // Method 1: Trigger change detection for this component and its children
    // Useful if the component's change detector was detached or for immediate updates.
    // this.cdr.detectChanges();

    // Method 2: Mark this component and ancestors for check (common with OnPush)
    // This is usually sufficient and more performant than detectChanges() when using OnPush.
    // This example uses a signal, which will automatically mark the component dirty when read in template.
    // However, if `message` was a regular property, `markForCheck()` would be crucial.
    this.cdr.markForCheck();

    // Method 3: Trigger change detection for the entire application
    // this.appRef.tick();
  }
}
```

## Understanding Angular's default change detection

By default, Angular applications use Zone.js to automatically detect changes. Zone.js patches asynchronous browser APIs (like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `Promise` resolutions, and event listeners) and notifies Angular whenever one of these operations completes. Angular then runs its change detection mechanism to check the component tree from top to bottom and update the DOM if necessary.

This automatic detection works well for most applications, providing a "just works" experience without much boilerplate. However, modern Angular (available from Angular 16 onwards) has introduced Signals as a new reactivity primitive that offers a more fine-grained, explicit, and potentially Zone.js-independent approach to change detection. While Zone.js is still the default, Signals enable developers to write applications that can eventually opt out of Zone.js for change detection entirely. Even with Signals, understanding manual change detection remains crucial for `OnPush` components or when interacting with non-Angular code.

## Why manually trigger change detection?

Manual triggering of change detection is typically required in these situations:

### Using the `OnPush` change detection strategy

When a component uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`, Angular optimizes its change detection by only checking it under specific conditions:

- Its inputs change by reference. If you mutate an object or array passed as an input without creating a new reference, Angular (by default) won't detect the change

- It emits an event

- An observable linked via the `async` pipe emits a new value

- You manually trigger change detection

If you mutate an input object or array (instead of providing a new reference) or update component state based on something not covered by the above (e.g., a `setTimeout` inside the component that doesn't correctly trigger Zone.js, or a third-party library callback), Angular won't detect the change automatically with `OnPush`.

### Working outside Zone.js

If you are running code completely outside of Angular's `NgZone` (e.g., in a Web Worker, or integrating with a JavaScript library that doesn't run within the Angular zone), changes made in that code won't automatically trigger Angular's change detection. In such cases, you must explicitly tell Angular to check for updates.

### Detaching the change detector

You can detach a component's change detector using `ChangeDetectorRef.detach()`. This stops Angular from automatically checking that component and its subtree during normal change detection cycles. You would then need to manually trigger checks using `detectChanges()` when needed. This is an advanced technique typically used for performance optimization in very specific scenarios where a component updates infrequently or its data changes are controlled outside the normal flow.

### Leveraging Angular Signals (Available from Angular 16 onwards)

While Signals reduce the need for manual change detection for state managed by Signals, `markForCheck()` can still be relevant when:

- You're mixing Signal-based and traditional mutable state within an `OnPush` component

- A change originating from an `effect` (which runs outside the Zone but can modify state) needs to ensure the view updates

- You are migrating an existing `OnPush` component to Signals gradually

Even in a fully "Zone-less" application (where Zone.js is explicitly removed or configured to do nothing), manual change detection methods like `markForCheck()` will still be essential for components not directly consuming Signals or for specific interaction patterns.

## Methods for manual triggering

Angular provides the `ChangeDetectorRef` and `ApplicationRef` services to manually control change detection.

### `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`

- **What it does**: Runs change detection for the **current component and its entire subtree** (all its children and their children, etc.), regardless of their `ChangeDetectionStrategy` (even `OnPush` components in its subtree will be checked)

- **When to use**:

  - When you have explicitly detached the change detector (`detach()`) and need to check the component and its children

  - When you know a change has occurred within the component's view or a child's view that `OnPush` or Zone.js might miss, and you need the update to reflect immediately

  - In integration tests to force an update after manipulating component state

- **Considerations**: Can be less performant than `markForCheck()` if used excessively, as it checks the entire subtree even if only a small part has changed. Use it when an immediate, localized full check is necessary

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectorRef, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-manual-detect',
  template: `
    <p>Value: {{ value() }}</p>
    <button (click)="updateValue()">Update</button>
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class ManualDetectComponent {
  value = signal(0); // Using a signal

  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  updateValue() {
    this.value.update(val => val + 1); // Update the signal

    // Manually trigger detection for this component and its children.
    // While signals often update automatically, this explicitly forces it.
    this.cdr.detectChanges();
  }
}
```

### `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`

- **What it does**: Marks the component as "dirty" (needs to be checked) and also marks all its ancestors up to the root component. It **does not trigger change detection immediately**. Instead, it ensures that the component will be checked during the _next_ change detection cycle, whether that cycle is triggered by Zone.js (e.g., an event occurring) or `ApplicationRef.tick()`

- **When to use**:

  - This is the **preferred method when using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`**. If you update component state (e.g., a private property, or mutate an input object) based on an asynchronous operation or an input mutation that doesn't trigger `OnPush` automatically, call `markForCheck()` to tell Angular that this component needs to be included in the next check

  - When you update data in a service that the component relies on, and the component uses `OnPush`

  - When a `Signal` (available from Angular 16 onwards) is read in an `OnPush` component's template, and that Signal's value changes, Angular automatically calls `markForCheck()` for that component. This means explicit `markForCheck()` might be less frequently needed with Signals but is still a valuable tool for non-Signal state or specific control flows

- **Considerations**: It's more performant than `detectChanges()` because it doesn't immediately traverse the subtree. It just marks the path for the next global check. It relies on a future change detection cycle to actually perform the update.

```typescript
import {
  Component,
  ChangeDetectorRef,
  ChangeDetectionStrategy,
  signal, // Available from Angular 16 onwards
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-mark-for-check',
  template: `
    <p>Count: {{ count() }}</p>
    <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, // Using OnPush
  standalone: true,
})
export class MarkForCheckComponent {
  count = signal(0); // Using a signal

  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  increment() {
    // Update component state (e.g., a signal)
    this.count.update(val => val + 1);
    console.log('Count updated:', this.count());

    // Mark component for check - usually handled automatically by Signals
    // when `count()` is read in the template, but explicitly showing its usage.
    // If `count` was a plain property, `this.cdr.markForCheck()` would be essential here.
    this.cdr.markForCheck();
  }
}
```

In the example above, if `count` were a regular property instead of a signal, `this.cdr.markForCheck()` would be critical. The button click event itself triggers a Zone.js microtask, which leads to a change detection cycle. `markForCheck()` ensures that this specific component is included in that cycle, even though its input didn't change and it didn't emit an event. If the `count` was updated by something not triggering Zone.js (like a WebSocket message received outside the zone), `markForCheck()` would still be needed, and you might also need `detectChanges()` or rely on another Zone-triggered event to eventually run the check. However, `markForCheck()` is generally safer and more efficient with `OnPush`.

### `ApplicationRef.tick()`

- **What it does**: Triggers a change detection cycle for the **entire application**, starting from the root component. It's equivalent to Angular's default behavior when Zone.js detects a change (e.g., after an event handler completes)

- **When to use**:

  - In testing scenarios to simulate a full change detection cycle

  - When running code completely outside of Zone.js (e.g., in a Web Worker, or if Zone.js is explicitly disabled/noop'd) and you need to update the entire application's view based on results from external operations

- **Considerations**: This is the most heavy-handed approach as it checks the whole application tree. It should be used sparingly and only when a global change detection sweep is truly required

```typescript
import { Component, ApplicationRef, signal } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-app-tick',
  template: `
    <p>Status: {{ status() }}</p>
    <button (click)="updateStatus()">Update Status (App Tick)</button>
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class AppTickComponent {
  status = signal('Initial');

  constructor(private appRef: ApplicationRef) {}

  updateStatus() {
    this.status.set('Updated at ' + new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    console.log('Status updated:', this.status());

    // Trigger change detection for the entire application
    this.appRef.tick();
  }
}
```

## Choosing the right method

- For `OnPush` components: Prefer `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`. It's the most efficient way to signal that the component needs checking during the next cycle. When using Signals, this is often handled automatically, but knowing `markForCheck()` is still valuable for fine-tuning or hybrid scenarios

- For detached components: Use `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` to explicitly check the component and its subtree when needed

- For global updates or testing outside Zone.js: Use `ApplicationRef.tick()`

Avoid `detectChanges()` on `OnPush` components unless strictly necessary (e.g., you need an immediate update within a complex interaction or animation frame that `markForCheck` might miss before the next tick). `markForCheck` is generally sufficient and better aligns with the `OnPush` philosophy. As Angular's reactivity evolves with Signals, the need for explicit manual change detection for Signal-managed state will decrease, but it will remain a critical tool for integrating with external libraries or managing complex scenarios outside of the new reactivity model.
