title: What is property binding? How is it different from event binding?

## TL;DR

Property binding in Angular allows you to set the value of a target element's property using a component's property value. The data flow is one-way, from the component class to the DOM element or directive property. You use square brackets `[]` around the target property name, like `[src]="imageUrl"`.

Event binding, on the other hand, lets you listen for events dispatched by a target element (like a button click or input change) and execute a method in your component class when that event occurs. The data flow is from the DOM element to the component. You use parentheses `()` around the target event name, like `(click)="saveData()"`.

The main difference is the direction of data flow: property binding sends data _to_ the element, while event binding receives notifications _from_ the element.

## What is property binding?

Property binding is a technique in Angular that allows you to set the value of a target HTML element's property or a directive's `@Input()` property using a value from your component class. It establishes a one-way data flow from the component to the view (the DOM).

### Purpose of property binding

The primary purpose is to dynamically update the properties of DOM elements or Angular components/directives based on the state of your component class. This includes setting attributes like `src`, `href`, `alt`, `disabled`, `value`, or passing data to child components via their input properties.

### Syntax for property binding

The syntax involves enclosing the target element property name in square brackets `[]` on the left side of the assignment, and the component property or expression on the right side:

```html
<img [src]="product.imageUrl" [alt]="product.name" />
<button [disabled]="isSaving">Save</button>
<app-child [data]="parentData"></app-child>
```

Angular evaluates the expression inside the quotes (`product.imageUrl`, `isSaving`, `parentData`) and sets the corresponding property of the element or directive.

### Example of property binding

Consider a component with a property `isButtonDisabled`. You can bind this property to the `disabled` property of a button:

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <button [disabled]="isButtonDisabled">Click Me</button>
    <p>Button is {{ isButtonDisabled ? 'disabled' : 'enabled' }}</p>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  isButtonDisabled = true;

  // Method to toggle the state (optional, for demonstration)
  toggleButtonState() {
    this.isButtonDisabled = !this.isButtonDisabled;
  }
}
```

When `isButtonDisabled` is `true`, the button will be disabled. When it's `false`, the button will be enabled.

## What is event binding?

Event binding in Angular allows you to listen for specific events (like clicks, keypresses, mouseovers, form submissions) on DOM elements or Angular components/directives and execute a method in your component class when that event occurs. It establishes a one-way data flow from the view (the DOM) to the component.

### Purpose of event binding

The main purpose is to react to user interactions or other events happening in the view and update the component's state or trigger actions accordingly.

### Syntax for event binding

The syntax involves enclosing the target event name in parentheses `()` on the left side of the assignment, and a component method call or statement on the right side:

```html
<button (click)="saveData()">Save</button>
<input (input)="onInputChange($event)" />
<form (submit)="onSubmit($event)">Submit</form>
<app-child (outputEvent)="handleOutput($event)"></app-child>
```

When the specified event occurs (e.g., the button is clicked), Angular executes the statement or method call inside the quotes (`saveData()`, `onInputChange($event)`, `onSubmit($event)`, `handleOutput($event)`). The `$event` variable often contains information about the event, such as input values or emitted data from an `@Output()`.

### Example of event binding

Consider a button that, when clicked, calls a method `incrementCount` in your component:

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <button (click)="incrementCount()">Increment</button>
    <p>Count: {{ clickCount }}</p>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  clickCount = 0;

  incrementCount() {
    this.clickCount++;
  }
}
```

Each time the button is clicked, the `incrementCount` method is executed, updating the `clickCount` property, which is then displayed in the paragraph via interpolation.

## How is property binding different from event binding?

The key differences lie in their purpose, syntax, and the direction of data flow:

### Purpose

- **Property Binding:** Used to set or update the properties of a DOM element or directive based on component data. It's about _displaying_ data or configuring elements.
- **Event Binding:** Used to listen for events triggered by a DOM element or directive and execute component logic in response. It's about _reacting_ to user actions or view events.

### Syntax

- **Property Binding:** Uses square brackets `[]` around the target property name: `[property]="componentProperty"`.
- **Event Binding:** Uses parentheses `()` around the target event name: `(event)="componentMethod()"`.

### Data Flow

- **Property Binding:** One-way data flow from the component class _to_ the view (DOM/directive property).
- **Event Binding:** One-way data flow from the view (DOM event) _to_ the component class (method execution).

### Analogy

Think of property binding like setting the initial state or configuration of a device (e.g., setting the volume level on a speaker). Think of event binding like the device sending a signal back when something happens (e.g., the speaker sending a signal when a button is pressed).

In summary, property binding pushes data _out_ to the view, while event binding pulls information or triggers actions _in_ from the view.
