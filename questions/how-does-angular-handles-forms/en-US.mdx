title: How does Angular handle forms?
---

## TL;DR

Angular handles forms primarily through two distinct approaches: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms.

- **Template-driven forms** are simpler and suitable for basic forms. They rely heavily on directives like `ngModel` and `ngForm` directly within the template to manage form state and validation. The logic is largely handled by Angular directives in the HTML.
- **Reactive forms** are more robust and scalable, ideal for complex forms. They build the form model programmatically in the component class using classes like `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray`. This approach offers better testability, predictability, and control over form data flow and validation.

Choose Template-driven for simple forms and Reactive for more complex scenarios or when testability is a priority.

## How Angular handles forms

Angular provides powerful tools and techniques for managing user input through forms. It offers two main approaches to handle forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Both approaches manage form data flow, validation, and state, but they differ significantly in how the form model is created and managed.

### Template-driven forms

Template-driven forms are built by adding directives directly into your template HTML. They are suitable for simple forms where minimal logic is required in the component class.

- **How they work**: They rely on directives like `ngModel` to create `FormControl` instances implicitly for each input element. The `ngForm` directive automatically creates a `FormGroup` to wrap all controls within the form. Validation attributes (like `required`, `minlength`) are used directly in the template.
- **Setup**: You need to import `FormsModule` into your application or feature module.
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to set up for basic forms
  - Familiar syntax using HTML attributes
- **Cons**:
  - Less scalable for complex forms
  - Logic and validation are scattered within the template, making testing harder
  - Relies on mutable data changes via two-way data binding (`[(ngModel)]`)

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form #userForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(userForm)">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="name"
      name="name"
      [(ngModel)]="user.name"
      required
      minlength="4" />
    <div
      *ngIf="userForm.controls['name']?.invalid && (userForm.controls['name']?.dirty || userForm.controls['name']?.touched)">
      <div *ngIf="userForm.controls['name']?.errors?.['required']">
        Name is required
      </div>
      <div *ngIf="userForm.controls['name']?.errors?.['minlength']">
        Name must be at least 4 characters long
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" [disabled]="userForm.invalid">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgForm } from '@angular/forms'; // Import NgForm type

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  user = { name: '' };

  onSubmit(form: NgForm): void {
    console.log('Form submitted!', form.value);
    // Typically send data to a service here
  }
}
```

### Reactive forms

Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs. The form model is defined programmatically in the component class, offering greater control, predictability, and testability.

- **How they work**: You explicitly create instances of `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray` in your component class to represent the form structure. These objects are then linked to the template using directives like `formControlName` or `formGroupName`. Data flow is unidirectional (from model to view and view changes trigger model updates via observables).
- **Setup**: You need to import `ReactiveFormsModule` into your application or feature module.
- **Pros**:
  - More scalable and maintainable for complex forms
  - Easier to test because the form model is defined in the component class
  - Predictable data flow using observables
  - Better handling of dynamic forms and complex validation scenarios
  - Immutability (changes result in new state)
- **Cons**:
  - Requires more setup code in the component class

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<form [formGroup]="userForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" formControlName="name" />
    <div
      *ngIf="userForm.get('name')?.invalid && (userForm.get('name')?.dirty || userForm.get('name')?.touched)">
      <div *ngIf="userForm.get('name')?.errors?.['required']">
        Name is required
      </div>
      <div *ngIf="userForm.get('name')?.errors?.['minlength']">
        Name must be at least 4 characters long
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" [disabled]="userForm.invalid">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms'; // Import form classes

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  userForm = new FormGroup({
    name: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.minlength(4)]),
    // Add more controls here
  });

  onSubmit(): void {
    if (this.userForm.valid) {
      console.log('Form submitted!', this.userForm.value);
      // Typically send data to a service here
    }
  }
}
```

### Form validation

Both Template-driven and Reactive forms support validation.

- **Template-driven**: Uses HTML5 validation attributes (`required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`) and Angular directives. Custom validators are harder to implement and test.
- **Reactive**: Uses validator functions (`Validators.required`, `Validators.minlength`, etc.) passed when creating `FormControl` instances. Custom validators are functions that return a validation error object or `null`, making them easy to write and test. Asynchronous validators are also well-supported.

Both approaches expose form state properties (`valid`, `invalid`, `dirty`, `pristine`, `touched`, `untouched`) on the form and individual controls, allowing you to provide visual feedback to the user.

### Form submission

Form submission is typically handled by listening to the form's `ngSubmit` (Template-driven) or `ngSubmit` (Reactive) event and calling a method in the component class. Inside the method, you can access the form's value and state to process the data.

In summary, Angular provides a flexible and structured way to handle forms, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits the complexity and requirements of their application.
