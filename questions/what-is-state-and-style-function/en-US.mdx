title: What is State function and Style function?
---

## TL;DR

In Angular animations, `state()` and `style()` are functions used to define the visual appearance of an element at specific points in an animation.

- `state()`: This function defines a named state for an element, associating a name (like `'open'` or `'closed'`) with a specific set of CSS styles. It takes a state name (string) and a `style()` definition as arguments.
- `style()`: This function defines a set of CSS-like properties and their values that describe the appearance of an element at a particular moment. It's used within `state()`, `transition()`, and `keyframes()` to specify styles. It takes an object literal where keys are style properties and values are their desired settings.

Together, `state()` defines _what_ a state is named and _what_ it looks like using `style()`, while `style()` provides the actual visual description.

```typescript
import {
  trigger,
  state,
  style,
  transition,
  animate,
} from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <button [@myAnimation]="currentState" (click)="toggleState()">
      Animate Me
    </button>
  `,
  animations: [
    trigger('myAnimation', [
      // Define states using state() and style()
      state(
        'default',
        style({
          backgroundColor: 'blue',
          transform: 'scale(1)',
        })
      ),
      state(
        'highlighted',
        style({
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          transform: 'scale(1.1)',
        })
      ),
      // Define transitions between states
      transition('default => highlighted', [animate('300ms ease-in')]),
      transition('highlighted => default', [animate('300ms ease-out')]),
    ]),
  ],
})
export class MyComponent {
  currentState = 'default';

  toggleState() {
    this.currentState =
      this.currentState === 'default' ? 'highlighted' : 'default';
  }
}
```

## State function

The `state()` function in Angular's animations module is used to define a named state within an animation `trigger`. It associates a specific name (a string) with a set of CSS-like styles defined using the `style()` function.

### Purpose of state()

The primary purpose of `state()` is to give a meaningful name to a particular visual configuration of an element. Instead of referring to an element's appearance solely by its CSS properties, you can refer to it by a state name like `'open'`, `'closed'`, `'visible'`, `'hidden'`, `'default'`, or `'active'`. This makes animation definitions more readable and maintainable.

### How state() is used

`state()` is always used within the array of definitions provided to the `trigger()` function. It takes two arguments:

1.  A string representing the name of the state (e.g., `'open'`, `'closed'`).
2.  A call to the `style()` function, which defines the CSS properties for that state.

### Example of state()

```typescript
import { trigger, state, style } from '@angular/animations';

animations: [
  trigger('myTrigger', [
    // Define a state named 'void' (used for elements entering/leaving)
    state(
      'void',
      style({
        opacity: 0,
        transform: 'translateX(-100%)',
      })
    ),
    // Define a state named 'visible'
    state(
      'visible',
      style({
        opacity: 1,
        transform: 'translateX(0)',
      })
    ),
    // Define a state named 'hidden'
    state(
      'hidden',
      style({
        opacity: 0,
        transform: 'translateX(100%)',
      })
    ),
  ]),
];
```

In this example, we define three states: `'void'`, `'visible'`, and `'hidden'`, each associated with different `opacity` and `transform` styles. These state names can then be used in `transition()` definitions to animate between them.

## Style function

The `style()` function in Angular's animations module is used to define a set of CSS-like properties and their values. It describes the visual appearance of an element at a specific point in time, such as the beginning or end of a state, or at a specific frame within a transition.

### Purpose of style()

The purpose of `style()` is to provide a declarative way to specify the CSS properties that should be applied to an element. It acts like an inline style object but is used within the animation definition syntax.

### How style() is used

`style()` is a fundamental building block used in several places within Angular animation definitions:

- **Within `state()`**: To define the styles associated with a named state.
- **Within `transition()`**: To define the starting styles (optional) and ending styles (often implicitly defined by the target state) of a transition, or to define styles at specific offsets within an `animate()` step.
- **Within `keyframes()`**: To define the styles at specific points (offsets) within a keyframe animation sequence.

It takes a single argument: an object literal where keys are CSS property names (usually camelCase, like `backgroundColor` or `transform`) and values are their desired settings (strings or numbers).

### Special properties in style()

`style()` supports some special property names:

- `*`: Represents any style property. This is often used in `state('*')` to match any state that hasn't been explicitly defined, or in `transition()` to match any starting or ending state.
- `void`: Represents the state where an element is not attached to the DOM. This is commonly used in transitions for elements entering (`:enter` or `void => *`) or leaving (`:leave` or `* => void`) the view.

### Example of style()

```typescript
import { style } from '@angular/animations';

// Example usage within a state definition
state(
  'closed',
  style({
    width: '0px',
    opacity: 0,
    backgroundColor: 'grey',
  })
);

// Example usage within a transition's animate step
transition('open => closed', [
  animate('1s', style({ opacity: 0.5 })), // Animate to 50% opacity over 1s
  animate('500ms', style({ width: '0px', backgroundColor: 'grey' })), // Then animate width and color over 500ms
]);

// Example usage within keyframes
animate(
  '1s',
  keyframes([
    style({ opacity: 0, offset: 0 }), // Start at 0% opacity
    style({ opacity: 0.5, offset: 0.5 }), // At 50% of the animation, be at 50% opacity
    style({ opacity: 1, offset: 1 }), // End at 100% opacity
  ])
);
```

In these examples, `style()` is used to specify the exact visual properties (like `width`, `opacity`, `backgroundColor`) at different points in the animation sequence.

## How state() and style() work together

`state()` and `style()` are fundamentally linked. `state()` provides the _name_ for a visual configuration, while `style()` provides the _description_ of that configuration. You cannot define a state without specifying its styles using `style()`, and `style()` is most commonly used _within_ a `state()` definition to give meaning to a set of styles.

When an element's animation binding (`[@triggerName]`) changes its bound value to match a defined state name, Angular knows which set of styles (defined by the `style()` within that `state()`) the element should eventually reach. The animation system then calculates the transition needed to animate from the element's current styles to the target state's styles, based on the defined `transition()` rules.
