title: What are `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` and how do they differ?
---

## TL;DR

`viewChild()` and `contentChild()` are functions (APIs) introduced in Angular that provide a modern, functional, and signal-based way to query elements or directives from a component's template or projected content. They are available from Angular 17.1 onwards.

- `viewChild()` queries for the _first_ element or directive within the **component's own template**. It returns a `Signal` that will emit the queried instance (or `undefined`/`null`) after the view is initialized.
- `contentChild()` queries for the _first_ element or directive that is **projected into the component** via `<ng-content>`. It also returns a `Signal` that will emit the queried instance after the projected content is initialized.

The core difference is their lookup scope: `viewChild()` looks inside the component's internal view, while `contentChild()` looks within the content provided by a parent component through content projection. Both return reactive Signals, making their values automatically update when the queried element appears or disappears.

```typescript
import {
  Component,
  ElementRef,
  AfterViewInit,
  AfterContentInit,
  viewChild,
  contentChild,
  signal,
  computed,
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <p #myViewElement>This is part of the component's view.</p>
    <ng-content></ng-content>
    @if (viewElement()) {
    <p>View element is present!</p>
    } @if (projectedElement()) {
    <p>Projected element is present!</p>
    }
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit, AfterContentInit {
  // Queries the <p> tag within this component's template
  viewElement = viewChild<ElementRef>('myViewElement');

  // Queries an element projected into <ng-content>
  projectedElement = contentChild<ElementRef>('myProjectedElement');

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    // The signal's value is available here, or can be read reactively in templates or effects
    console.log('View Element:', this.viewElement()?.nativeElement);
  }

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    // The signal's value is available here, or can be read reactively in templates or effects
    console.log('Projected Element:', this.projectedElement()?.nativeElement);
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- Usage of MyComponent -->
<app-my-component>
  <div #myProjectedElement>This is projected content.</div>
</app-my-component>
```

## What are `viewChild()` and `contentChild()`?

Available from Angular 17.1 onwards, `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` are new functional APIs designed to query for elements, components, or directives within an Angular application's template or projected content. Unlike their decorator counterparts (`@ViewChild()` and `@ContentChild()`), these new APIs return reactive Signals, providing improved type safety, consistency, and a more streamlined developer experience, especially in a world moving towards fine-grained reactivity.

### `viewChild()`

The `viewChild()` function allows you to query for and obtain a reference to the _first_ element, component, or directive matching a selector within the component's _own template_. It's used when a component needs to interact with its internal DOM structure or child components it directly renders.

### How to use `viewChild()`

You call `viewChild()` within the component's class definition, typically as a class property. It returns a `Signal<T | undefined | null>` where `T` is the type of the queried instance (e.g., `ElementRef`, `MyChildComponent`).

```typescript
import { Component, ElementRef, AfterViewInit, viewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { MyButtonComponent } from './my-button/my-button.component'; // Assuming this is a standalone component

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent-view',
  template: `
    <div #myDivInView>Hello from inside parent view!</div>
    <app-my-button></app-my-button>
  `,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [MyButtonComponent], // Import standalone child component
})
export class ParentViewComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  // Querying a native DOM element using a template reference variable
  myDiv = viewChild<ElementRef>('myDivInView');

  // Querying a child component instance by its type
  myButton = viewChild(MyButtonComponent);

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    // Access the signal's value using the function call syntax
    console.log(
      'Div element in view:',
      this.myDiv()?.nativeElement.textContent
    );
    this.myButton()?.doSomething(); // Call a method on the child component
  }
}
```

The value of the `myDiv` and `myButton` signals will be populated after Angular has initialized the component's view. This typically means the signal's value will be available starting from the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook, or reactively when read in templates or effects.

### The `required` option

You can specify the `required: true` option to indicate that the queried element _must_ be present in the view. If it's not found, Angular will throw an error. This is useful for ensuring critical elements are always available. When `required` is `true`, the returned signal type is `Signal<T>` (not `T | undefined | null>`).

```typescript
import { Component, ElementRef, viewChild } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-required-view-child',
  template: `
    <input #requiredInput type="text" placeholder="Required input" />
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class RequiredViewChildComponent {
  // This signal will always hold an ElementRef, or Angular will throw if not found
  requiredInputField = viewChild<ElementRef>('requiredInput', {
    required: true,
  });

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.requiredInputField().nativeElement.focus(); // No need for null check
  }
}
```

### `contentChild()`

The `contentChild()` function allows you to query for and obtain a reference to the _first_ element, component, or directive that is _projected_ into the component via the `<ng-content>` element. This is useful when building components that act as containers or wrappers, needing to interact with the external content provided by their parent components.

### How to use `contentChild()`

Similar to `viewChild()`, you call `contentChild()` as a class property within the component. It returns a `Signal<T | undefined | null>` where `T` is the type of the queried instance.

```typescript
import {
  Component,
  ElementRef,
  AfterContentInit,
  contentChild,
} from '@angular/core';
import { CardHeaderDirective } from './card-header.directive'; // Assuming this directive exists

@Component({
  selector: 'app-card',
  template: `
    <div class="card-container">
      <ng-content select="[cardHeader]"></ng-content>
      <div class="card-body">
        <ng-content></ng-content>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class CardComponent implements AfterContentInit {
  // Queries for an element with the `cardHeader` directive applied (e.g., <h2 cardHeader>)
  cardHeader = contentChild(CardHeaderDirective);

  // Queries for a native element with a template reference variable '#cardBodyContent'
  cardBodyContent = contentChild<ElementRef>('cardBodyContent');

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    // Access the signal's value using the function call syntax
    if (this.cardHeader()) {
      console.log('Card header directive found on projected content.');
    }
    console.log(
      'Projected body content:',
      this.cardBodyContent()?.nativeElement.textContent
    );
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- Usage of CardComponent -->
<app-card>
  <h2 cardHeader>Welcome to My Card</h2>
  <div #cardBodyContent>This is the main content of the card.</div>
  <p>More projected content.</p>
</app-card>
```

The value of the `cardHeader` and `cardBodyContent` signals will be populated after Angular has initialized the projected content. This typically means the signal's value will be available starting from the `ngAfterContentInit` lifecycle hook, or reactively when read in templates or effects.

### The `required` option

Similar to `viewChild()`, `contentChild()` also supports the `required: true` option. If the projected content matching the query is not found and `required` is `true`, Angular will throw an error.

```typescript
import { Component, contentChild, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-strict-container',
  template: ` <ng-content select=".main-content"></ng-content> `,
  standalone: true,
})
export class StrictContainerComponent {
  // Requires a projected element with class 'main-content'
  mainContent = contentChild<ElementRef>('.main-content', { required: true });

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    this.mainContent().nativeElement.style.border = '2px solid blue';
  }
}
```

## Key Differences

The fundamental differences between `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` lie in _where_ they perform the query, _when_ their resulting signals are populated, and how they contribute to Angular's new reactivity model.

### Query Location

- **`viewChild()`**: Queries elements/directives strictly _within the component's own template_. These are elements the component itself declares and renders as part of its view.
- **`contentChild()`**: Queries elements/directives that are _projected into_ the component from a parent component using the `<ng-content>` element. These elements are defined by the parent but are rendered inside the child's `<ng-content>` slot.

### Availability Timing

Both `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` return Signals, meaning their values are reactive and will update as the queried element becomes available or changes.

- **`viewChild()`**: The signal's value typically resolves and becomes available after the component's _view_ has been initialized. This corresponds to the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook. If you read the signal in the component's template or an `effect`, it will automatically react to its value being set.
- **`contentChild()`**: The signal's value typically resolves and becomes available after the _projected content_ has been initialized. This corresponds to the `ngAfterContentInit` lifecycle hook. Similarly, reading this signal in templates or effects will provide reactivity.

### Reactivity and Signals

A major distinction from the older decorator-based queries is that `viewChild()` and `contentChild()` return **Signals**. This means:

- **Automatic Updates**: If the queried element appears (e.g., due to an `*ngIf` becoming true) or disappears, the signal's value will automatically update (from `undefined` to the instance, or vice-versa), triggering change detection for any part of your template or any `effect` that reads that signal.
- **No `static` Option**: The functional APIs do not have a `static` option. They inherently behave dynamically, similar to how `@ViewChild({ static: false })` and `@ContentChild({ static: false })` worked, resolving the query after the relevant view/content initialization. This simplifies the API and aligns with the reactive nature.
- **Improved Type Safety**: By explicitly returning `Signal<T | undefined | null>` (or `Signal<T>` with `required: true`), these APIs offer better type inference and enforce safer access to the queried instance.

### Use Cases

- **`viewChild()`**: Ideal for direct manipulation of the component's own rendered DOM (e.g., setting focus on an input after initialization), interacting with child components it owns (e.g., calling a method on a child), or getting measurements of elements that are part of its fixed structure.
- **`contentChild()`**: Perfect for creating flexible, reusable container components that need to introspect or interact with the content provided by their users. This enables patterns like custom form controls that inspect projected inputs, or layout components that organize projected sections (e.g., a tab component reading projected `<app-tab-panel>` components).
