title: What are template expressions and template statements?
---

## TL;DR

In Angular templates, you use two main types of syntax to interact with your component's data and logic: template expressions and template statements.

- **Template expressions** are used for data binding. They evaluate to a value and are typically used to display data (`{{ user.name }}`) or bind properties (`[src]="imageUrl"`). They are read-only and cannot change the state of the application directly (e.g., no assignments like `x = 1`).
- **Template statements** are used for event binding. They execute code in response to an event (`(click)="saveData()"`). They can call component methods or perform simple assignments.

## Template expressions

Template expressions are pieces of code within your Angular template that evaluate to a value. Angular executes these expressions and assigns the result to a binding target property.

### Where they are used

Template expressions are primarily used in:

- **Interpolation:** Using double curly braces `{{ expression }}` to display a value in the HTML.
- **Property binding:** Using square brackets `[targetProperty]="expression"` to bind a property of an HTML element or directive to the result of an expression.

### Context of execution

Template expressions are evaluated within the context of the component instance associated with the template. This means you can access properties and methods of that component directly within the expression.

### Allowed syntax

Template expressions support a subset of JavaScript syntax. You can use:

- Property access (e.g., `user.name`)
- Method calls (e.g., `getUserName()`)
- Arithmetic operations (e.g., `price * quantity`)
- String concatenation (e.g., `'Hello ' + name`)
- Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g., `isLoggedIn ? 'Logout' : 'Login'`)
- Nullish coalescing operator (e.g., `user.name ?? 'Guest'`)
- Pipe operators (e.g., `date | date:'short'`)

### Disallowed syntax

Certain JavaScript syntax is explicitly disallowed in template expressions to prevent side effects and maintain readability. These include:

- Assignments (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- `new` operator
- `typeof` operator
- Increment and decrement operators (`++`, `--`)
- Keywords like `let`, `const`, `var`, `await`
- Chaining multiple expressions with semicolons (`;`)

### Examples

```html
<!-- Interpolation -->
<p>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</p>
<p>Total: {{ price * quantity | currency }}</p>

<!-- Property Binding -->
<img [src]="imageUrl" [alt]="imageAltText" />
<button [disabled]="isSaving">Save</button>
<div [class.active]="isActive"></div>
```

## Template statements

Template statements are pieces of code within your Angular template that execute an action in response to an event.

### Where they are used

Template statements are primarily used in:

- **Event binding:** Using parentheses `(targetEvent)="statement"` to respond to events emitted by HTML elements or directives.

### Context of execution

Like expressions, template statements are executed within the context of the component instance.

### Allowed syntax

Template statements are more permissive than expressions regarding side effects because their purpose is to change application state. You can use:

- Method calls (e.g., `saveData()`, `deleteItem(item)`)
- Assignments (e.g., `value = $event.target.value`)
- Accessing event properties using the `$event` variable (e.g., `$event.target.value`)

### Disallowed syntax

Similar to expressions, certain complex or potentially harmful syntax is disallowed:

- `new` operator
- `typeof` operator
- Increment and decrement operators (`++`, `--`)
- Keywords like `let`, `const`, `var`, `await`
- Chaining multiple statements with semicolons (`;`)

### Examples

```html
<!-- Event Binding -->
<button (click)="saveData()">Save</button>
<input (input)="userName = $event.target.value" [value]="userName" />
<form (submit)="onSubmit($event)">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Key differences

The fundamental difference lies in their purpose and allowed operations:

- **Purpose:** Expressions _evaluate_ to a value (read-only), statements _execute_ code (can have side effects).
- **Usage:** Expressions are used for data binding (`{{}}`, `[]`), statements for event binding (`()`).
- **Assignments:** Statements allow assignments (`=`), expressions do not.
- **Method Calls:** Both allow method calls, but in different contexts (expressions use the return value, statements execute the method).
