title: What is a router outlet?
---

## TL;DR

A `RouterOutlet` is a directive provided by Angular's router module. It acts as a placeholder in your application's template where the router should display the component corresponding to the current route. When the URL changes and matches a configured route, the router dynamically loads the associated component and renders it inside the `<router-outlet>` tag. Think of it as a dynamic slot in your layout that gets filled with different components depending on the navigation state.

## What is RouterOutlet?

The `RouterOutlet` is a directive from the `@angular/router` library. It is a fundamental part of Angular's routing system. Its primary purpose is to mark the location within a template where the component associated with the active route should be rendered.

### Placeholder for routed components

Essentially, `<router-outlet>` serves as a dynamic placeholder. When the Angular router determines which component should be displayed based on the current URL, it renders that component inside the element where the `RouterOutlet` directive is placed.

## Purpose of RouterOutlet

The main purpose of the `RouterOutlet` is to enable single-page applications (SPAs) to display different views (components) without requiring a full page reload.

### Dynamic content rendering

Instead of having static content or manually managing which component is visible, the `RouterOutlet` allows the router to handle this dynamically. As the user navigates through the application, the router swaps out the component currently displayed within the `RouterOutlet` with the component for the new route.

### Structuring application layout

Typically, you place the `RouterOutlet` in your application's main layout component (like `AppComponent`). This allows common elements like headers, footers, or navigation bars to remain static while only the main content area changes based on the route.

## How RouterOutlet works

1.  **Route Matching:** The Angular router listens for changes in the browser's URL.
2.  **Configuration Lookup:** It compares the current URL against the route configurations defined in your application.
3.  **Component Identification:** Once a match is found, the router identifies the component associated with that route.
4.  **Rendering:** The router then instantiates that component and renders its view inside the `<router-outlet>` element found in the template.
5.  **Destruction:** If the route changes again, the router destroys the previously rendered component before rendering the new one in the same location.

## Usage

You use the `RouterOutlet` directive by simply adding the `<router-outlet>` tag to your component's template where you want the routed content to appear.

### Basic example

In a typical application, you might place it in your main `app.component.html`:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-header></app-header>

<main>
  <!-- This is where routed components will be displayed -->
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</main>

<app-footer></app-footer>
```

With a route configuration like this:

```typescript
// app.routes.ts (or app-routing.module.ts)
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  // ... other routes
];
```

When the user navigates to `/`, the `HomeComponent` will be rendered inside the `<router-outlet>`. When they navigate to `/about`, the `AboutComponent` will replace the `HomeComponent` inside the same `<router-outlet>`.

### Multiple and named outlets

Angular also supports multiple `RouterOutlet` instances in a single template, which is useful for complex layouts (e.g., a main content area and a sidebar that changes with the route). These are typically used with [named outlets](https://angular.dev/guide/router/routing#named-outlets):

```html
<!-- Complex layout example -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="main-content">
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    <!-- Primary outlet -->
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar">
    <router-outlet name="sidebar"></router-outlet>
    <!-- Named outlet -->
  </div>
</div>
```

And the corresponding route configuration would specify which outlet to target:

```typescript
// Example route config for named outlet
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { MainComponent } from './main/main.component';
import { SidebarComponent } from './sidebar/sidebar.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    component: MainComponent, // Renders in the primary outlet
    children: [
      {
        path: 'details',
        component: SidebarComponent, // Renders in the primary outlet by default
        outlet: 'sidebar', // Renders in the 'sidebar' named outlet instead
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...
];
```
