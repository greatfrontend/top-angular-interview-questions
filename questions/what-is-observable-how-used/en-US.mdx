title: What is an observable and how is it used?
---

## TL;DR

An Observable represents a stream of data or events over time. It's a core concept in reactive programming and is used extensively in Angular for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, user input events, and routing changes.

Think of it as a producer that pushes multiple values to consumers (called Observers) over time. You subscribe to an Observable to start receiving these values.

Key characteristics:

- **Lazy:** Nothing happens until you subscribe
- **Asynchronous:** Designed for operations that complete over time
- **Multiple values:** Can emit zero, one, or many values
- **Cancellable:** Subscriptions can be easily cancelled
- **Composable:** Can be transformed and combined using operators

In Angular, you'll commonly subscribe to Observables returned by the `HttpClient` for API calls, or Observables representing form value changes or router events. It's crucial to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks, although the `async` pipe handles this automatically in templates.

## What is an observable?

An Observable is a fundamental building block in reactive programming, representing a collection of multiple values over time. Unlike a regular function that returns a single value or a Promise that returns a single value asynchronously, an Observable can emit zero, one, or many values over its lifetime. It's a "push" system, meaning the Observable pushes data to its consumers (called Observers) when it's ready.

Observables are provided by the RxJS library, which Angular uses heavily for handling asynchronous operations and event management.

### Key concepts

- **Producer:** The source that creates the stream of data. This could be an HTTP request, a DOM event listener, an interval timer, etc.
- **Observable:** The wrapper around the producer that defines how values are delivered to subscribers.
- **Observer (or Consumer):** An object with callback functions (`next`, `error`, `complete`) that receives notifications from the Observable.
- **Subscription:** The result of calling the `subscribe()` method on an Observable. It represents the ongoing execution of the Observable and allows for cancelling the execution (unsubscribing).

### Observable notifications

An Observable can notify its Observer(s) in three ways:

- `next(value)`: Pushes the next value in the stream to the Observer. This can happen multiple times.
- `error(err)`: Pushes an error notification to the Observer. This terminates the Observable execution.
- `complete()`: Pushes a completion notification to the Observer. This indicates that the Observable has finished emitting values and terminates the execution.

Once an Observable emits an `error` or `complete` notification, it cannot emit any further `next` values.

## How is an observable used in Angular?

Observables are pervasive in Angular applications for managing asynchronous operations and handling streams of data or events.

### Handling HTTP requests

The `HttpClient` service in Angular returns Observables for all its methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc.). You subscribe to these Observables to receive the response data.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  template: `
    <h2>Users</h2>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let user of users">{{ user.name }}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class UserListComponent implements OnInit {
  users: User[] = [];
  users$: Observable<User[]> | undefined; // Using async pipe

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Method 1: Subscribe manually
    this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users').subscribe({
      next: data => (this.users = data),
      error: err => console.error('Error fetching users', err),
      complete: () => console.log('User fetch complete'),
    });

    // Method 2: Using async pipe in template (preferred for simple cases)
    this.users$ = this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users');
  }
}
```

When using the `async` pipe in the template (`<li *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">`), Angular automatically subscribes to the Observable when the component is initialized and unsubscribes when the component is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.

### Handling events

Angular's event system, especially for reactive forms or router events, often exposes streams as Observables.

- **Reactive Forms:** `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray` have `valueChanges` and `statusChanges` properties which are Observables.

  ```typescript
  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';
  import { debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators';

  @Component({
    selector: 'app-search',
    template: `
      <form [formGroup]="searchForm">
        <input formControlName="query" placeholder="Search..." />
      </form>
    `,
  })
  export class SearchComponent implements OnInit {
    searchForm: FormGroup;

    constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
      this.searchForm = this.fb.group({
        query: [''],
      });
    }

    ngOnInit(): void {
      this.searchForm
        .get('query')
        ?.valueChanges.pipe(debounceTime(300)) // Wait 300ms after last keystroke
        .subscribe(query => {
          console.log('Search query changed:', query);
          // Perform search based on query
        });
    }
  }
  ```

- **Router Events:** The Angular `Router` service provides an `events` property, which is an Observable stream of navigation events.

  ```typescript
  import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  import { Router, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';
  import { filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

  @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: '<router-outlet></router-outlet>',
  })
  export class AppComponent {
    constructor(private router: Router) {
      this.router.events
        .pipe(filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd))
        .subscribe(event => {
          console.log('Navigation ended:', event);
          // Perform actions after navigation
        });
    }
  }
  ```

### State management

While Signals (available from Angular 16) offer a modern approach to fine-grained reactivity and state management, Observables remain crucial for handling asynchronous state updates, streams of actions, and integrating with libraries like NgRx.

### Using operators

RxJS provides a rich set of operators that allow you to transform, filter, combine, and manipulate Observables. These are essential for building complex asynchronous logic. Examples include `map`, `filter`, `debounceTime`, `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `combineLatest`, etc.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-list',
  template: `
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let product of products">
        {{ product.name }} - {{ product.price | currency }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  products: Product[] = [];

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.http
      .get<Product[]>('/api/products')
      .pipe(
        // Use map operator to transform the data
        map(products => products.filter(p => p.price > 10)), // Filter products over $10
        catchError(error => {
          // Handle errors
          console.error('Error fetching products', error);
          return []; // Return an empty array or rethrow
        })
      )
      .subscribe({
        next: filteredProducts => (this.products = filteredProducts),
        error: err => console.error('Subscription error', err), // This catches errors not handled by catchError
      });
  }
}
```

### Unsubscribing

When you manually subscribe to an Observable in a component class, it's critical to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks. This is typically done in the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { interval, Subscription } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-timer',
  template: ` <p>Timer: {{ counter }}</p> `,
})
export class TimerComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  counter = 0;
  private timerSubscription: Subscription | undefined;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.timerSubscription = interval(1000).subscribe(value => {
      this.counter = value;
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    // Unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks
    if (this.timerSubscription) {
      this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
  }
}
```

As mentioned, the `async` pipe handles this automatically for Observables used directly in templates, making it the preferred approach for many scenarios.

## Observable vs Promise

While both Observables and Promises are used for asynchronous operations, they have key differences:

- **Values:** Promises emit a single value (or an error). Observables can emit multiple values over time.
- **Laziness:** Promises are eager; they start executing as soon as they are created. Observables are lazy; they only start executing when you subscribe to them.
- **Cancellability:** Promises are not easily cancellable once started. Observables are cancellable by calling `unsubscribe()` on the Subscription.
- **Composability:** Observables are highly composable using a wide range of operators. Promises have limited composition capabilities (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`).

For operations that return a single result (like a simple HTTP GET), a Promise might seem sufficient, but Angular's consistent use of Observables (even for single-value HTTP responses) allows you to leverage the full power of RxJS operators for transformation, error handling, and combining multiple asynchronous sources.
